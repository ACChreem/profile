        <h2>&#127942 I live for challenges &#127942</h2>
        <p>
        I'm Brazilian, 28 years old and I currently live in US &#9996.
        I work as a backend developer and am passionate about solving problems.
        I chose LeWagon to become an even better developer and get to know frontEnd.
        I am very curious to discover this new world! &#129299

          <h1>Why I live in Us? </h1>
          <p>
            I came to the States with my husband.  At first, I came because he would study at the
            University of Pennsylvania but I realized it would be a great opportunity for me to
            study too and today I am doing a master's degree also at the University of Pennsylvania.
            The experience is being amazing and I confess that I do not know if I want to go back to Brazil. &#129325

          Some of the languages I use are C# and SQL database.
